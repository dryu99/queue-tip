# Queue-tip
Simple web app that allows users to create and join rooms, and participate in an online queueing system.

## Purpose
Primarily built for TAs who are tired of managing chaotic whiteboard queues and rubbing off marker ink with their hands. Should also come in handy in the midst of a global pandemic.

## Tech Stack
- **Client**: React, socket.io-client
- **Server**: Node.js, socket.io

socket.io was used to facilitate bi-directional client to server communication. This made it possible to create isolated rooms with real-time server updates to all participating clients.

## Why is the UI so ugly
Because UI is my passion.
