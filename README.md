# queue-tip
Simple web app that allows users to facilitate online queues with ease. No sign-up required!

You can check it out [here](http://www.queuetip.org/)!

## Purpose
I primarily developed this for teaching staff who host online office hours or labs. Using google docs and the like to manage queues can be a hassle, so I thought building this single purpose app would help maintain sanity. 

## How to use
1. Create room
2. Send room link to participants
3. Watch users join queue
4. Remove users from queue
5. Enjoy animal emojis (each user is assigned a unique one üêí)

## Tech Stack
- **Client**: JavaScript, React 
- **Server**: TypeScript, Node.js, socket.io
